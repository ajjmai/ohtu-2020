Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel is a retrospective technique, the aim of which is to obtain feedback on what should be continued and what should not.
The feedback is collected on a poster with a circle drawn on it. The circle is divided into 5 sections each named with a word in the retrospective name. This retrospective should last about 10 minutes.

Glad, Sad, Mad is a "no gimmicks" retrospective plan. It is much longer than the above mentioned Start, Stop,... retrospective, taking up to 60 minutes.
In this retrospect, all issues and observations made during the sprint are listed and then categorised to one of the three categories in the retrospective name. These issues are then discussed in an order voted by the participants.
